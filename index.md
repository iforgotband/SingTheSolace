To ring in the new year ... I'm really proud and simultaneously incredibly embarassed to present you with *etAletAI - Sing the Solace.* A couple tracks are special, and shown here. They'll be the singles I'm sure.

### Track 5 - Pray

Lyrics for this track were *performed* by CasJKer, and written by Maynard James Keenan for Puscifer. This song is about a succubus, who will destroy you. This is the non-explicit art, the other is on soundcloud if you want to see it (oooh the nips).

Singer is Dot, and the song probably somehow isn't obvious. Sometimes ... you don't need to understand consciously, and you'll get it when you need to get it. But ... you'll get it.
