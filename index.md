etAletAI - Sing the Solace
===

To ring in the new year ... I'm really proud and simultaneously incredibly embarassed to present you with this, world. I'll explain a bit about a couple tracks below. I'll also be setting up a donation-by-crypto thing so you can send funds with which to do things like buying modern laptops for people who would be artists if only there were tools.

### Track 5 - Pray

Lyrics for this track were *performed* by CasJKer, and written by Maynard James Keenan for Puscifer. This song is about a succubus, who will destroy you. This is the non-explicit art, the other is on soundcloud if you want to see it (oooh the nips).

### Track 1 - No Children Anymore

Singer is Dot, and the song probably somehow isn't obvious. Sometimes ... you don't need to understand consciously, and you'll get it when you need to get it. But ... you'll get it.
